# tree-sitter-jsonnet

[jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org) grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)

This is alpha quality. It's been tested on a large corpus of documents as well as all the upstream
jsonnet test_suite documents, so it parses most things. However, careful checks have *not* been made
to ensure precedence etc all work correctly.

Issues/patches welcome.
